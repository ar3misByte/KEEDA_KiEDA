# KiCad Live — Troubleshooting

Every entry below is a failure that actually happened while building or testing
this project. Each gives SYMPTOM / CAUSE / CHECK / FIX / VERIFY.

**Start here.** These three commands identify most problems in under a minute:

```powershell
python tools\check_env.py --server SERVER_IP     # is this machine ready?
curl http://SERVER_IP:8000/health                # is the server alive?
python tools\enable_kicad_api.py --check         # is the KiCad API on?
```

---

## 1. The server does not start

**SYMPTOM**
`python -m server.main` exits immediately, or prints
`[Errno 10048] error while attempting to bind on address`.

**CAUSE**
Port 8000 is already taken — usually by a server you forgot to stop.

**CHECK**
```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name like '%python%'" |
  Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -like '*server.main*' } |
  Select-Object ProcessId, CommandLine
```

**FIX**
Stop the old server, or use another port.
```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name like '%python%'" |
  Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -like '*server.main*' } |
  ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.ProcessId -Force }

python -m server.main --port 8001
```

**VERIFY**
`curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` returns `{"status":"ok",...}`.

---

## 2. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'` (or `kipy`, `websockets`)

**SYMPTOM**
Any command fails on import.

**CAUSE**
The virtual environment is not active, or dependencies were never installed.

**CHECK**
```powershell
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```
The path should be inside your project's `.venv`.

**FIX**
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If activation is blocked:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

**VERIFY**
`python -c "import fastapi, websockets, kipy; print('ok')"`

---

## 3. A client cannot connect to the server

**SYMPTOM**
The agent prints `connection lost` / `reconnecting in 1s` for ever, or the
browser cannot open `http://SERVER_IP:8000/health`.

**CAUSE**
Wrong IP, the firewall, or the machines are on different networks.

**CHECK**
On the client:
```powershell
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName SERVER_IP -Port 8000
```
* `PingSucceeded: False` **and** `TcpTestSucceeded: False` → not the same network.
* `PingSucceeded: True` **but** `TcpTestSucceeded: False` → firewall.

On the server, confirm the address and that it is listening:
```powershell
ipconfig | Select-String "IPv4"
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000 -State Listen
```

**FIX**
1. Use the IP on the same subnet as the clients. Ignore `169.254.*` addresses
   and VirtualBox/WSL/Hyper-V adapters.
2. Add the firewall rule, in an **Administrator** PowerShell on the server:
   ```powershell
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "KiCad Live" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8000 -Action Allow
   ```
3. Make sure the server was not started with `--host 127.0.0.1`, which accepts
   local connections only. The default `0.0.0.0` is what you want.
4. On guest/corporate Wi-Fi, "client isolation" can block machine-to-machine
   traffic entirely. Use a phone hotspot or a switch instead.

**VERIFY**
`http://SERVER_IP:8000/health` loads from a *different* computer.

---

## 4. The agent cannot connect to KiCad

**SYMPTOM**
```text
[FAIL] Could not connect to KiCad.
       could not reach KiCad (...). Is KiCad running with a PCB open, and is
       'Enable KiCad API' ticked in Preferences > Plugins?
```

**CAUSE** (in order of likelihood)
1. The API is not enabled.
2. It was enabled but KiCad was not restarted.
3. KiCad is not running, or has no **PCB** open (the schematic editor is not enough).
4. KiCad 8 or older — the IPC API does not exist there.
5. The setting was changed while KiCad was open, so KiCad overwrote it on exit.

**CHECK**
```powershell
python tools\enable_kicad_api.py --check
Get-Process pcbnew, kicad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
And confirm the version in **Help → About KiCad** is 9.0 or newer.

**FIX**
1. Close KiCad **completely**.
2. `python tools\enable_kicad_api.py`
3. Start KiCad and open a PCB.
4. `python tools\check_env.py`

**VERIFY**
`[PASS] Connected to KiCad - 10.0.6`

---

## 5. `the client <name> already has a commit in progress`

**SYMPTOM**
The agent or a tool fails with that error and never recovers.

**CAUSE**
A client began a KiCad commit and died before finishing it. KiCad tracks open
commits **per client name** and keeps that commit open. Verified behaviour: it
survives reconnection and is only cleared by restarting KiCad.

**CHECK**
The error message names the client. If it starts with `kicad-live-`, it came
from this project.

**FIX**
Restart KiCad. That is the only way to clear a stuck commit.

This should not recur: the agent wraps every commit in `try/finally` with
`drop_commit`, and each run uses a **unique client name**, so a crashed run can
never block the next one. If you see it repeatedly, file it — something is
crashing between `begin_commit` and `push_commit`.

**VERIFY**
`python tools\check_env.py` reaches `[PASS] Board is writable`.

---

## 6. The plugin does not appear in KiCad

**SYMPTOM**
**Tools → External Plugins** has no "KiCad Live" entry.

**CAUSE**
Not installed, installed into another KiCad version's folder, KiCad not
restarted, or the plugin raised on import.

**CHECK**
```powershell
python tools\install_plugin.py --list
Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\KiCad\10.0\scripting\plugins\kicad_live\last_load.json"
```
`last_load.json` is written every time KiCad imports the plugin:
* `"status": "loaded"` → it imported fine; you are looking in the wrong menu.
* `"status": "failed"` → `detail` holds the traceback.
* file missing → KiCad never imported it at all.

**FIX**
```powershell
python tools\install_plugin.py
```
then **restart KiCad**. KiCad only scans for plugins at startup. If several
KiCad versions are installed, the installer writes to all of them; make sure
you restarted the one you are actually using.

**VERIFY**
```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\KiCad\10.0\bin\python.exe" tests\manual\test_plugin_loads.py
```
then check **Tools → External Plugins**.

---

## 7. The plugin appears but does nothing / shows an error

**SYMPTOM**
Clicking the menu entry shows "KiCad Live is not configured" or
"The Python interpreter recorded for KiCad Live no longer exists".

**CAUSE**
The plugin is a launcher. It stores the repository path and the interpreter in
`kicad_live_config.json` at install time. Moving or renaming the repository, or
deleting `.venv`, invalidates it.

**CHECK**
```powershell
Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\KiCad\10.0\scripting\plugins\kicad_live\kicad_live_config.json"
```

**FIX**
Re-run `python tools\install_plugin.py` from the repository's current location.

**VERIFY**
The dialog opens and the agent starts in a new console window.

---

## 8. Changes are not synchronising

**SYMPTOM**
Two agents are connected but moving a part on one does nothing on the other.

**CAUSE** (in order)
1. The two machines are in **different projects**.
2. The boards have **different UUIDs** (they were not copied from the same file).
3. The component is locked by someone else.
4. The change conflicted.

**CHECK**
Compare the `Project` line printed by each agent — they must match exactly.

Then compare UUIDs across machines:
```powershell
python -c "from agent.kicad_link import KiCadLink; l=KiCadLink(); l.connect(); [print(v['reference'], v['uuid']) for v in sorted(l.read_snapshot().values(), key=lambda s: s['reference'])]"
```
The UUID for R1 must be **identical** on every machine.

Watch the agent console. It logs `LOCAL <summary>` when it sends and
`REMOTE <summary>` when it applies.

**FIX**
* Different projects → pass the same `--project demo_board` on every machine.
* Different UUIDs → copy one machine's `sample_project/demo_board.kicad_pcb` to
  all the others and reopen it. UUIDs are how objects are matched; boards that
  merely *look* the same will not sync.
* Locked → the console says so by name; wait or ask them to deselect.
* Conflict → the console prints a CONFLICT block. See entry 11.

**VERIFY**
Move R1 and watch the other machine's console print `REMOTE moved R1 ...`.

---

## 9. An infinite synchronisation loop

**SYMPTOM**
A component jitters continuously, or the logs show endless changes for one part.

**CAUSE**
This is the failure the design specifically prevents, so seeing it means a bug.
Two guards exist: the baseline is updated to the expected post-state *before*
each remote write, and a one-poll-cycle echo mark backs that up.

**CHECK**
Stop every agent but one. If the jitter stops, it was a loop between two agents.
Run with `--verbose` and look for repeated `LOCAL`/`REMOTE` lines on one UUID.

**FIX**
Stop all agents, restart the server (`Ctrl+C`, then start again), then start the
agents one at a time. If it recurs, capture `--verbose` logs from both agents —
it is a genuine defect.

**VERIFY**
`tests/manual/test_live_sync.py` includes a test that asserts no spurious
traffic once idle, and `tests/unit/test_echo_suppression.py` covers the logic.

---

## 10. Two clients show different board states

**SYMPTOM**
R1 is in different places on two machines and stays that way.

**CAUSE**
One agent was disconnected while the other kept working, or a change was
refused and the board drifted.

**CHECK**
Compare the dashboard's **Version** number with what each agent believes. Check
the server's authoritative value:
```powershell
curl http://SERVER_IP:8000/api/status
```

**FIX**
Restart the out-of-date agent. On connect it receives the full `project_state`
and **adopts the server's values**, applying whatever is needed to its board.
Reconnection is deliberately one-directional: a returning client can never
overwrite work done while it was away.

**VERIFY**
The agent logs `adopting N field(s) from the server`, and the boards match.

---

## 11. A conflict was reported

**SYMPTOM**
```text
==============================================================
  CONFLICT on R1.position
    you changed it to : {'x': 40.0, 'y': 35.0}
    Aditya changed it to : {'x': 45.0, 'y': 30.0}
    your base v7, server is at v8
  KiCad Live will not guess. Reverting to the server's value.
  To keep YOUR value instead, move R1 again now.
==============================================================
```

**CAUSE**
Two people changed the same field of the same component from the same starting
point. This is working as designed — the system detects it and refuses to merge.

**CHECK**
The message names the other person and both values.

**FIX**
Your board is put back to the server's value so the two do not silently
diverge. If your value was the right one, simply move the part again — that is
a fresh change from the current version and will be accepted.

To avoid conflicts entirely, **select a component before editing it**; selecting
it takes a soft lock automatically.

**VERIFY**
The dashboard's Activity feed shows the conflict, then your new change.

---

## 12. A lock is stuck

**SYMPTOM**
The dashboard shows a component locked by someone who has left.

**CAUSE**
Normally impossible — disconnecting releases all of a client's locks
immediately. A lock can linger only if a client is still connected but idle.

**CHECK**
The dashboard shows a countdown next to each lock.

**FIX**
Wait. Locks expire after **120 seconds** without refresh, and the server's
janitor reclaims them within 5 seconds of expiry. To release immediately, the
owner deselects the component or stops their agent.

**VERIFY**
The lock disappears from the dashboard and someone else can select the part.

---

## 13. A WebSocket keeps disconnecting

**SYMPTOM**
The agent cycles between `connected` and `connection lost`.

**CAUSE**
Flaky Wi-Fi, the machine sleeping, or the server being restarted.

**CHECK**
The agent's reconnect backoff (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 s) is visible in its log. A
client silent for 30 s is dropped by the server and will reconnect on its own.

**FIX**
This is handled automatically — the agent reconnects for ever and resyncs from
`project_state` each time. Nothing is lost. For a stable demo prefer wired
Ethernet, and disable sleep:
```powershell
powercfg /change standby-timeout-ac 0
```

**VERIFY**
The dashboard shows the designer back online with the correct state.

---

## 14. The server crashed or was restarted

**SYMPTOM**
Every agent reports the connection lost at once.

**CAUSE**
The server process ended.

**CHECK**
Look at the server console for a traceback.

**FIX**
Start it again with the same command. Agents reconnect by themselves within
about ten seconds. Documented recovery behaviour:

* Object state is held **in memory** and is lost on restart.
* Change **history is persisted** to `data/<project>.history.jsonl`, and version
  numbering continues from where it left off, so versions never go backwards.
* The first agent to reconnect **re-seeds** the project from its own board.
* Locks are not persisted; everyone starts unlocked.

Because state is reseeded from a live board, the important thing after a server
restart is that the agents are all still running — they are the backup.

**VERIFY**
`curl http://SERVER_IP:8000/health` is ok, the dashboard repopulates, and a test
move propagates.

---

## 15. KiCad says the board has changed on disk

**SYMPTOM**
A "file has changed on disk / reload?" dialog appears.

**CAUSE**
**KiCad Live never writes your board file**, so this did not come from us. It
means something else touched the file — a shared folder, a sync client
(OneDrive/Dropbox), or another editor.

**CHECK**
Is the project inside a synced or shared folder?

**FIX**
Move the project to a local, non-synced folder. Each designer keeps their own
local copy (see Getting Started step 9). KiCad Live synchronises live objects
over the network, not files.

**VERIFY**
The dialog stops appearing.

---

## 16. Git or version history fails

**SYMPTOM**
`could not append history for <project>` in the server log.

**CAUSE**
The `data/` directory is not writable, or the disk is full.

**CHECK**
```powershell
Test-Path .\data
New-Item -ItemType File .\data\write-test.tmp; Remove-Item .\data\write-test.tmp
```

**FIX**
Fix the permissions, or point the server elsewhere:
```powershell
$env:KICADLIVE_DATA_DIR = "C:\temp\kicadlive"
python -m server.main
```

History is deliberately **non-fatal**: synchronisation continues even if history
cannot be written, and the failure is logged rather than raised. Git is not
required — the demo must not fail because a Git identity is unconfigured.

**VERIFY**
`data\demo_board.history.jsonl` grows as changes are accepted.

---

## 17. Rotation (or another field) does not synchronise

**SYMPTOM**
Moving a part syncs, but rotating it does not.

**CAUSE**
Historically a bug in this project: a short-circuiting `any()` meant only the
first changed field of an object was applied. Fixed, and covered by tests.

**CHECK**
```powershell
python -m pytest tests\unit -q
```

**FIX**
Make sure you are on current code. The combined move+rotate path is exercised by
`tools/check_env.py` and by the unit tests.

**VERIFY**
Rotate a part with **R** and watch the other machine follow.

---

## 18. A designer's first change after restarting the agent is ignored

**SYMPTOM**
The agent logs `LOCAL moved R1 ...` but nobody receives it.

**CAUSE**
Historically a bug: change ids restarted at 1 each run, so the server's
duplicate-replay guard discarded them. Fixed — ids now carry a per-run token,
and the guard is scoped per client.

**CHECK**
The server logs neither a broadcast nor a conflict for the change.

**FIX**
Update to current code.

**VERIFY**
`tests/unit/test_echo_suppression.py::TestChangeIds` and
`tests/manual/test_live_locks.py` both cover this.

---

## 19. The dashboard is blank or says "Disconnected"

**SYMPTOM**
The page loads but shows no designers.

**CAUSE**
The dashboard follows **one project**, `demo_board` by default. If your agents
use a different project id, the dashboard shows nothing.

**CHECK**
Compare the `Project` line in an agent's output with the dashboard's
**Project** tile.

**FIX**
Open the dashboard with the right project:
`http://SERVER_IP:8000/?project=my_board`

**VERIFY**
The designer list fills in.

---

## 20. Nothing works and the demo is in five minutes

Fall back to the KiCad-free path. It exercises the server, presence, locks,
conflicts and history without any KiCad at all:

```powershell
python tools\test_client.py --server SERVER_IP --name "Designer A"
python tools\test_client.py --server SERVER_IP --name "Designer B"
```

Then follow the backup script in `docs/DEMO.md`. It demonstrates every feature
except live board updates — and it is honest about what is being shown.

---

## 21. "KiCad is busy and cannot respond to API requests now"

**SYMPTOM**
The agent prints `KiCad is busy ... waiting`, or this computer never picks up
work that is already in the project, or its own edits never reach the others.

**CAUSE**
KiCad answers "busy" while a **dialog is open**, while you are **mid-drag or in
an interactive tool**, or while it is **still loading the board**. It is
temporary. Older versions treated it as a lost connection: the initial state
sync gave up and never retried, the user showed as offline, and locks could be
released.

**CHECK**
Look for `KiCad is busy` followed by `KiCad is responding again` in the agent
window. If it never recovers, KiCad still has a dialog open.

**FIX**
1. Update to the current code (`git pull`), then restart the agent.
2. Close any open dialog in KiCad (Preferences, Plot, Board Setup, a message
   box). Modal dialogs block the API entirely.
3. Start the agent only after the board has finished loading.

The agent now waits for KiCad, queues incoming changes **in order**, and applies
them when KiCad responds. Nobody is shown as offline while KiCad is merely busy.
At startup it waits up to 60 s before giving up.

**VERIFY**
`KiCad is responding again` appears, then a change made on another computer
shows up on this board.

**Note on schematics**
Other people's schematic changes cannot appear live in your open eeschema
(KiCad 10 has no API for it). Instead the agent shares the saved `.kicad_sch`
files every 2 minutes and writes teammates' sheets into your project folder;
reload the sheet (File > Revert, or reopen) to see them. See
`docs/SCHEMATIC.md` section 2b.

---

## 22. "KiCad is busy" / "Timed out" / "no handler available" that never goes away

**CAUSE (reproduced on KiCad 10.0.6, Windows):** KiCad has ONE API socket per
computer (`%TEMP%\kicad\api.sock`). The **first KiCad program to start owns it**
- the project manager (`kicad.exe`), the schematic editor (`eeschema.exe`), or a
leftover/crashed process still running in Task Manager. A PCB editor started
AFTER that never gets the socket, so the agent talks to the wrong program, which
answers "no handler available", "busy" or nothing at all (timed out). Closing
dialogs does not help.

**FIX**
1. Close every KiCad window.
2. Task Manager -> end any `kicad.exe`, `eeschema.exe`, `pcbnew.exe` still listed.
3. Open the **PCB editor first**: double-click the `.kicad_pcb` file (do not start
   the project manager or schematic editor first).
4. `python tools/check_env.py` must now show all PASS. Only then open the
   schematic editor if you need it (it does not use the socket).

`tools/check_env.py` and the agent now print which KiCad programs are running.
If the socket is still unusable, run the agent with `--file-only`
(docs/LIVE_SCHEMATIC.md): it needs no KiCad API at all.
