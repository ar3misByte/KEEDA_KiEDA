"""Near-live schematic (and, optionally, PCB) sharing through the saved files.

eeschema has no live API, so an edit cannot be pushed into another user's open
editor as an object. What CAN be done, and is done here, is the whole loop a
person would otherwise do by hand:

    author edits  ->  editor saved (auto)  ->  file uploaded  ->  server tells
    everyone  ->  each agent MERGES it into the local file  ->  the editor is
    reloaded (auto File > Revert)

End to end this takes a few seconds. What this cannot do is show a change
BEFORE the author's editor saves it: the edit only exists in that editor's
memory until then. Auto-save (default 3 s after the first unsaved edit) keeps
that gap small.

Safety rules - never destroy someone's work:
  * Files are compared by sha256 against the last version both sides agreed on.
  * If both sides changed a file, the changes are MERGED object by object
    (common/sexpr_merge.py). Only a genuine clash on the same object falls back
    to writing the teammate's copy to `.kicad_live/incoming/`.
  * The old file is always backed up first; writes are atomic.
  * An editor with unsaved edits is saved first (auto-save) or, if auto-save is
    off, left alone and retried - it is never reverted over.
