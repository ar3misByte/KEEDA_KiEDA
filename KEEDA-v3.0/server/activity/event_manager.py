"""The unified activity/event system.

Every meaningful action in KiCad Live becomes one normalised event, whatever
domain it came from. The dashboard, the "what changed since I left" summary
and the change inspector all read from here, so there is exactly one story of
what happened to a project.

Events are recorded first and broadcast second: a dropped WebSocket frame must
never lose history.
